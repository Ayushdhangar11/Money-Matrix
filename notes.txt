-------------BASIC SETUP ------------------

 SO WE MADE env files that contians all the enviorment relates information 

 to access the env variabe we have ./utlis/get_env.ts which will get use the key and value from env file and return it to us

 then we have httpscongig - which will get the value form get_env and return it and we store them to desired varriabls
